This repository derives the analytical Jacobian of a 3-DOF spherical robotic arm using Denavit–Hartenberg parameters, implements forward kinematics, and maps joint rates to end-effector linear velocity. The code computes required joint velocities (and corresponding motor RPMs) to achieve prescribed end-effector velocities (e.g., v = [150, 100, 50] mm/s).

To fully comprehend the methodology, follow both the **reports** and the **codes**:
